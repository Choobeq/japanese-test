## How to use the Japanese Test
The test is asking only 10 questions. Every time it will ask 10 unique questions for each run.  
Also, it will check if the order of the words is correct, but this won't affect the score.  
After the last question, the score is displayed on the screen and the result
with the date and current time is saved to the file 'statistics.csv'
